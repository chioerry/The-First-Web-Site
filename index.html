<h4>Photography</h4>
<img src="img/photography.jpg" alt="Photography Image">

	When photographers talk about “exposure,” we simply mean the brightness or darkness of a photo.  It seems simple enough to take a photo that is correctly exposed (has the proper brightness or darkness), but in reality it can be quite the trick. If you're reading this Photo Basics series, it probably means that you currently shoot on the “Green mode” of your camera–or the automatic setting.  That means the camera entirely controls the exposure of the picture.  When you shoot on automatic mode, your camera selects an aperture setting, an ISO setting, a shutter speed, and a host of other settings for you.
	Automatic can be handy, but it also seriously limits your creative ability to make a beautiful picture.
	Want proof that automatic isn't the best way to shoot?  Check out the picture below.  On the left, the picture was taken entirely in automatic mode on a Canon Rebel DSLR.  That might look okay to you… until you see the picture on the right.  Same sunset.  Same camera.  The pictures were taken only seconds apart.  The difference?  The picture on the right was taken using manual exposure.

<h4>Direction</h4>
<img src="img/Direction.jpg" alt="Direction Image">
	A movie director is the chief person responsible for the creative aspects of film production. While creating the look of a film, movie directors may make script changes, determine movie locations, finalize costume designs, approve special effects, and provide coaching to actors. Jobs may be stressful, with often working under deadlines. Filming and directing in a wide range of weather conditions is also common in this profession. Formal education and training as a director is not required for a career in the field. Many movie directors begin making movies, such as short films or home movies, before going to film school. Others learn basic skills creatively without ever earning a film degree. For example, some professionals develop an interest in directing by working in various aspects of film development or production, such as screenwriting, producing or acting; generally, these professionals begin as assistants and work their way up. Aspiring directors may pursue a bachelor's degree program in fine arts, film, or a related field.

<h4>Acting</h4>
<img class="acting" src="img/acting.jpg" alt="Acting Image">
	Method acting is a famous acting technique that requires one to deeply embody their character. Learning how to method act requires a commitment to the process and a consistent practice schedule. However, the more you spend time practicing skills and techniques, the quicker you will be able to be in character and the better you will be able to perform. There are many resources and exercises that can help you achieve your desired level of method acting. Enrolling in an institution that specializes in method acting will provide you with classes, resources, and information about the history and techniques of method acting. Most programs also offer hands-on experience through class led performances as well as school wide performances. Another benefit of enrolling in a method acting program is the community of others who share similar interests, which can lead to further developments in your acting. There are many local classes available that do not require you to be enrolled in an acting school. Classes that are not institutionally associated can also have a wide variety of skill levels and interests creating a more diverse environment. Taking classes will allow you to get more professional advice and information about method acting without having to manage going to school while having other obligations. Your local theater community can be another useful resource for learning and discussing method acting and its techniques. Local theater communities are often made of individuals who are not professional actors and are still learning new skills and techniques. Relaxation is the key principle of method acting, which allows you to fully enter your role and perform to the best of your ability. Spend time relaxing before trying any exercises or acting scenes. Try to relax each part of your body individually at slow increments. The more relaxed you are the more you will be able to employ the techniques of method acting. Sense memory is the practice of trying to tap into memories of your senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste. Try thinking of a memory and concentrating on the different sensory experiences of that memory. One popular exercise that has to do with using sense memory is called the “personal object exercise,” which has the student explore an object that has personal significance to them with each one of their senses.

<li>Learn your lines so well that you never have to worry about them.</li>

<li>Never go dead for a second on stage. Even if you are doing nothing, do it actively. Listen.</li>
<li>If something goes wrong – say someone drops something – don't ignore it. Try to deal with it in character.</li>

<h4>Modelling Photography</h4>
Lets be honest, no model or agency is going to hire you if you don’t have any modeling or fashion pieces in your portfolio. You have to start somewhere, so find some friends who are up for modeling for you and hone your skills practicing with them. When you’re just starting you’ll most likely do a lot of shoots for free, but focus on getting in as much good work as possible and it will pay off down the road. If your friends are happy with your photos, they’ll most likely show their friends and as well as put them on Facebook and other social sites, which will only help in getting you exposure.

<h4>Handle Stardum</h4>
Probably the most important thing you can do as a successful actor is not let it get to your head. In spite of what the fans have told you, you are not the almighty. You are still just a flesh and blood person and as quickly as you became a star, that is how fast it can all come crashing down on you. So many stars who are big one day are gone the next and this dose of reality is too much for them to handle. As a result, their lives are never the same, many taking to drugs and booze. So keep your head about things. Make sure you put your success into perspective.gathered monarchies.

<h4>How to sell talent</h4>
Do you know what you offer to others? If you’re a physician, for example, do you offer relief from suffering? Wellness? Referrals? Diagnostic services? Stern lectures about smoking? Medicines? Preventive care?
All of the above, perhaps. But how do you share this with your patients in a way that they can remember it and benefit from it? Work on the exact description of what you offer and you’ll never hesitate to share it with anyone at any time. And you’ll smile while you’re sharing it because you believe in it so much.
The phrasing makes it even more real for you and the client. It becomes a meme.
